# 🛒 TikTok Shop – Software Engineering Group Project

This is a group project for the Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction (TEB2014) course, conducted during the May 2025 semester at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS.

Our project focuses on designing and developing a simulated version of TikTok Shop, an integrated e-commerce platform embedded within a social media environment. It aims to replicate the functionalities of TikTok's shopping feature, allowing users to browse, promote, and purchase products directly from video content. The system supports multiple stakeholders — including users, sellers, platform administrators, clients, and regulators — with tailored features like product tagging, personalized recommendations, storefront management, analytics, and secure transactions.

Built using modern web technologies and guided by Scrum methodology, this project showcases both our technical implementation and collaborative software development practices.
